# Face Mask Detection

A real-time face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. This project helps identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using webcam footage. It can be used for crowd monitoring and health safety in public places.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

## 📌 Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- CNN model trained on face mask dataset
- High accuracy on both masked and unmasked faces
- Easy to run and extend

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
3. Run `train_model.py` to train the model (or use pre-trained one)
4. Run `detect_mask.py` to test live via webcam

## 📁 Dataset
